# GeometrySimulator

## A simple Visual Studio Console Application which simulates a vector-based drawing package.



The program simulates drawing the following shapes:

1) rectangle
2) square
3) ellipse
4) circle
5) textbox

The application allows shapes to be added to the drawing, stating the location using (x,y) coordinates and other attributes depending on the individual shape. Key details of each shape (type, location, size/shape) will be printed to the console when the program is run.

- rectangle – width and height
- square – width
- ellipse –horizontal and vertical diameter
- circle – diameter
- textbox – bounding rectangle (i.e., the rectangle which surrounds the textbox; the text will be centred
within this rectangle).
